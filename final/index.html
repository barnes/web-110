    <h1>Final Project</h1>
    <p>Your final project is extremely open-ended. The goal is to demonstrate a deep understanding of the basics of HTML & CSS 
        by building one final and complete project. How you build, and what your build is completely up to you. You'll have the bulk of the
        last 2 classes to work on this.
    </p>
    <p>Use any previous code or resources from class, or any tutorial, guide, etc. Feel free to use Chatbots to help develop content and ideas,
        but avoid having the chatbot generate HTML & CSS, especially if it generates code you do not understand. 
    </p>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Multiple pages, at least 3</li>
        <li>Clean, readable content that is easy to navigate</li>
        <li>Robust CSS that styles the text styles and overall layout</li>
        <li>Minimal, modern styling, the site should look professional and modern</li>
        <li>Semantic HTML used throughout, code should be readable and clean</li>
        <li>Use of flexbox / CSS Grid for multi-column layouts</li>
        <li>Plenty of images, which can be sourced from services like Unsplash</li>
        <li>Deployed and available online, either via Github Pages, Glitch, Codepen, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Deliverables</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Your published site URL</li>
        <li>Your code itself, either a public repo, or the files themselves.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Bonus Challenges</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Responsive design that adapts to screen sizes</li>
        <li>Javascript for user interaction</li>
        <li>CSS Animations</li>
        <li>Use a minimal CSS framework like PicoCSS</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advice</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Focus on the layout and styling first, content second. Get the bulk of the site 'scaffolded' first.</li>
        <li>Incrementally add additional things like CSS libraries, JS, etc.</li>
        <li>Use chatbots to help guide your design and content.</li>
        <li>Use CSS snippets from sites like Codepen to have unique elements</li>
        <li>Create psuedo-templates, re-usable code snippets you can copy and paste throughout your site. You can stash these in 
            a different directory.
        </li>
        <li>Don't be afraid to throw things away and start over</li>
    </ul>
